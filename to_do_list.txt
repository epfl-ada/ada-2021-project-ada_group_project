What i did:

- changed the README file to :
. make a difference between our analysis of the citizens behavior and of the politicians behavior. Indeed, politicians opinion != citizens opinion
. reformulated some questions, to avoid the word "taboo" because in the milestone2 feedback, they asked how could we assess the taboo aspect
- modified the graph 'Difference between the number of different quotations and the total number of occurences per speaker in 2015' into distribution of quotations per speaker for a threshold of at least 20 quotations (as there a huge differences and too many values to plot), because there was a bias in Vermont for e.g where the senator talks a lot about gay rights, but it doesn't represent the citizens behavior. 

To be done:
- look at stats per speaker to have more meaningful information
- normalize the states with respect to their size (because for e.g, we cannot say that "that California has the highest number of hate crime related to sexual orientation. It is interesting to point it out as we have seen in the previous plot that California has lots of speakers on the matter of gay rights." cause it's the largest state)
OR/AND look at stats per capita 
- add a study about Trump
