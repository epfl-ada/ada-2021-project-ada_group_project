For Burstein, one of the focal points of â € œHillaryâ €  is to not only represent Clinton as a human being, rather than a political caricature, but to contextualize her, and the polarizing effect she has inspired, in the politics of gender. â € œThere is this criticism that sheâ € ™ s always known and calculated that sheâ € ™ s going to be president. Which, A, is not a bad thing, and, B, is actually not true, â €  Burstein said. â € œThere is an interview in the film with one of her colleagues at Yale Law School who says in in the early 70s the idea that a woman could be president was just so off the radar. â €  At Sundance, Clinton has been a regular presence. She attended the premiere of the Jamal Khasshoggi documentary â € œThe Dissident, â €  which she calls terrific. Experiencing a film festival, she says, has been thrilling. But Clinton's mind is mainly on the upcoming election. One of her chief concerns is that the vote wonâ € ™ t be carried out properly. â € œIt is a concern because once the Supreme Court gutted Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, they took away one of the most useful tools for holding states and local jurisdictions accountable for what they did around elections, â €  Clinton said. â € œAnd I was the first candidate running for president on the Democratic side who faced both the gutting of the Voting Rights Act and Citizens United. So I saw firsthand the concerted effort to purge voters and suppress voters. Thatâ € ™ s still going on. â €  Clinton, who beat Trump in the popular vote, favours the abolition of the Electoral College. â € œThe person who gets the most votes should win,",Hillary Clinton,['Q6294'],2020-01-27 21:29:34,1,"[['Hillary Clinton', '0.7676'], ['None', '0.2324']]",['https://medicinehatnews.com/news/world-news/2020/01/27/at-sundance-clinton-warns-of-voter-suppression-in-election/'],E

1405524,2020-02-18-093759,"Vollmann's sprawling and provocatively playful novel revisits the sordid setting of his early collection The Rainbow Stories, where sexual desire shapes characters' self-expression and pursuit of love, power, and human connection. A circle of friends is bonded by their relationship to a character named Neva, often referred to as `the lesbian.' They meet at a San Francisco spot called the Y Bar in 2015, where they find support in their collective company and become a de facto family. Among them are the matriarch, a bartender named Francine; Shantelle, a transgender prostitute; the largely unnoticed hard-drinking barfly Richard, who provides florid narration; and the starry-eyed Frank, who has renamed himself after his icon, Judy Garland. Vollmann elaborately researched the tumultuous life of the real Garland, lending passion and credence to Richard's extensive knowledge of the late singer. As Neva evolves from an innocent to an icon on par with Marlene Dietrich, at least in the eyes of the Y Bar circle, she guides and mentors their sexual self-discovery, helping define their boundaries and gain confidence. The Y Bar crowd's otherwise static plotlines are tightened by the interweaving of their common experiences. Vollmann's challenging novel is full of memorable moments.",William T.

You make the work that you want to see and that you hope becomes part of history. At the time that I was making these portraits, we were in a crisis in terms of visual culture, because of Jesse Helms and the National Endowment for the Arts. We'd had literally all of our arts funding taken away and conservative senators like Helms were actually holding up Robert Mapplethorpe photographs in court arguing why this type of art shouldn't be funded. On top of that, you had Reagan as President, completely ignoring the Aids epidemic. And so there was an enormous amount of activism that was dreadful to have to do, but what it did to coalesce the queer communities throughout the United States was really important. In `Being and Having' , I was trying to reframe the idea of portraiture. They're awkward portraits. That bright yellow background was a weird choice of colour for skin tone, where it wouldn't match but it allowed it to pop. Because if you're going to use colour, you might as well really try to use colour. That awkwardness of how the head was squished in was all about identity and the detail of how people were trimming and putting on their various moustaches with their various nicknames like Jake. One of the first places the pictures showed was the museum in Santa Barbara. Someone came up to me afterwards and was like, `I think I know some of these guys' . I was like, `you know, they're all lesbians with fake moustaches, right?'

We accomplished these results despite the continued negative impact in the global economy driven by US/China trade negotiations, Brexit uncertainty, global industrial production declines and significant commercial aerospace production delays at a key customer. We continue to gain traction on the key pillars of Vision 2025, under which we target: $8 billion in revenues, 20% operating margin, and 15% ROIC, all driving to $15 of earnings per share. As we embark on year three of Vision 2025, we will build on the achievements of our first two years and continue to drive towards our objectives of: achieving 5% organic growth with leverage, utilizing the Carlisle Operating System (COS) to deliver efficiencies and annual cost savings of 1-2% of revenues, deploying $3 billion to build scale with synergistic acquisitions, continuing to invest in exceptional talent and allocating over $3 billion into capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends. Full year 2019 highlights include: Delivered 2.8% organic revenue growth despite significant global headwinds; leveraged this growth to expand operating margins 220 basis points Drove organic revenue growth of 5.0% since launching Vision 2025, in line with our long-term target Maintained strong price discipline, leading to positive price realization across all businesses Achieved gross savings and benefits from COS within our targeted range of 1-2% of revenues Deployed over $600 million of capital into 8 strategic and synergistic acquisitions Leveraged our strong cash flow and balance sheet by deploying over $485 million into share repurchases and dividends paid; 3-year total of $1.4 billion In addition to our strong financial performance, we are pleased about the continued momentum our team has generated around Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) issues. In 2019 we established an ESG steering committee, developed an ESG reporting process, elevated the position of Director of Sustainability to report directly to the CEO and established a plan to publish our first ESG report in 2020. Additionally, we made progress in diversifying our Board of Directors and have made commitments to ensuring a $15 per hour minimum wage in our U.S. operations, gender pay equity, and a gender-balanced management team. We are pleased with our significant accomplishments and strong performance in a challenging 2019.
