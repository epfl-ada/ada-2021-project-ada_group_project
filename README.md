Title: Project Applied Data Analysis: Use of Quotebank to analyse evolution of Gay Rights in the USA from 2015 to 2020

Abstract: Through this project, we will use the great potential of Quotebank to analyse the evolution of Gay Rights in the USA: what are the opinions in different states? What is the president position? How did this topic evolve across time and state borders?  
One could say that it is sufficiant to read on the internet what is the situation related to this topic and then wonder what is the purpose of focusing our project on this subject? As it is kind of a controversial topic with various opinions, changes across time and different actors, it requires an analysis taking into account many parameters. We chose this topic because we thought that it would be more interesting to focus on a controversial theme that would thus refer to different actors (speakers) with meaningful statistics. Moreover, basing our analysis on a comparison between states should give more significant results than looking at the entire country without partitioning it.     

Research questions: 
We will ask ourselves several questions such as: 
In which way was there a change of the credits given to this topic between 2015 and 2020? 
Did the opinion of the president change? Are there real differences in opinion within and between states?
What are the main differences in laws and rights between states?
Are the observations different before and after laws were made (such as the gay wedding)? If so, in which direction did the opinions change? Did it change in a homogenous way?
Which states show the most similarities here? 
Are there some states where the topic is into the spotlight or some where it is  more of a taboo theme?
Does taboo mean non-acceptance?
Are there states with more hate crime related to sexual orientation?
How quotes about gay rights classed by locations are relevent about the mentality and general politic of a state?

Methods:
1/. Create a proper dataset mainly by searching for key words in the quote repository (refer to the code line 'words = ['lesbian', 'gay', 'homosexual', 'gender', 'bisexual', 'sexuality', 'same sex', ...]') and by grouping the politicians in different states to search for pertinent speakers.
2/. Filter if our datasets appears to be noisy (by checking if basic statistics are plausible for example)
3/. Aggregate our data in a meaningful way:
we will generate various dataframe to fragment the information in function of the year for the analysis across time. We could also group data by states to realize the analysis across and within each of them.
4/. Create relevant visualizations to analyze the data: this is a necessary step to check for correlation, for specific patterns or for unexpected trends for example. 
5/. Think critically about our data: this part will be the most concluing one and should be smooth if the previous steps have been realized with success. Here we should be able to finally answer to the research questions.

Timeline: we will have 5 weeks to realize the project (12.11-17.12). The tasks number below correspond to the tasks in the above section.
Week1 (12.11-19.11): task 1 + additional researches of quotations if needed;
Week2 (19.11-26.11): task 2;
Week3 (26.11-03.12): task 3;
Week4 (03.12-10.12): task 4;
Week5 (10.12-17.12): task 5;

Organization within the team:
Alexiane: Plotting graphs during data analysis, crawling the data, preliminary data analysis;
Meghan: Problem formulation, coming up with the algorithm;
Elsa: Coding up the algorithm, running tests, tabulating final results;
Naomie: Writing up the report or the data story, preparing the final presentation.
